# Change Detection beyond 2D with Multimodal Data

[arXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09276)

This repository contains the code and resources for multimodal change detection, a technique for detecting changes between different data modalities, such as satellite images and digital surface models (DSMs).

## Dataset
We provide a DSM-to-image multimodal dataset, which detecting multi-category building change from height data and aerial images, called Hi-BCD. You can download the dataset via: [ITC-sever](https://eostore.itc.utwente.nl:5001/sharing/HQQUzD7H3) with password itc2023 or [BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1tgF56e1sOe51ZrWuS7mTGA?pwd=lz0y) or [GoogleNetdisk](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E5-h0s4l7LtLnR6CD2F7_Es1MlFZRti9?usp=sharing).

![Data](/utils/src/data1.jpg "Data")

It is constructed for detecting 2D and 3D changes simultaneously from cross-dimensional modalities. Some samples are as follow:

 ![Data_sample](/utils/src/data_sample.jpg "Data_sample")

It includes 1500 pairs of high-resolution tiles emcompassing three cities in the Netherlands. The details of Hi-BCD dataset are as follow:
